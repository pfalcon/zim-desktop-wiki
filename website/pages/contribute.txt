===== Donations =====
Zim is completely free software, free as in open source //and// free as in free beer. However if you feel like stimulating further development of zim, you can make a donation using the paypal button below.

INSERT_PAYPAL_BUTTON_HERE

In the paypal form there is a link "Suggestions and Comments" (it is a bit small but it is there when you confirm the donation). Feel free to use this text field to tell me what is on your wish list for future development. I can not promise to implement every feature that gets mentioned in a donation, but it will certainly be taken into consideration. If enough funds come in we will set up bounties for other developers that want to work on nominated features as well.
